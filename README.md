# todo
A simple TODO app using Angular and other web technologies such as web storage and websockets

The user/login functionality is only a mock for now and the actual todo app will be served under /user.
Also, this supports persistent storage in a mongodb database. Please add the required config file yourself. Once this is setup different sessions should update live via websocket.
